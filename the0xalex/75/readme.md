# the0xalex 75 (ANSI)

A tenkeyless 75% keyboard bastardized from some off-the-shelf boards, including a Ducky, 
a Glorious, and a Keychron. 

WestBerry G7 ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller.  Figuring out the io-pinout for the WB32FQ95 was a
nightmare.  Note to self: don't do that again.

## Case Screw Notes

I used the GMMK 3 PRO case.  I liked the angle, the aluminum, and the general layout.  
Obtained used from a bricked board for $20.

Screws for the case suck though, so I tried some options.

This seems pretty close (2024-12-13):
* Thread: M2
* Thread length: ~5 mm
* Head diameter: ~3.8 mm
* Head counterbore diameter: ~4.0 mm
* Head counterbore depth: ~1.9 mm

[this hex socket head screw](https://www.mcmaster.com/91292A005/) from McMaster-Carr is what I bought 
(head will protrude above the counterbore by ~0.1 mm).
